# Visa Solutions Workforce (Interview Task)

This project was developed as part of an interview task for Visa Solutions Workforce.

## Project Description

The task was to create a home website based on a brochure. The main focus was on visual elements, requiring the integration of all brand materials and elements to ensure consistency and alignment with the brand identity.

## Important Note
The ideal resolution for this project is 1080p (1920x1080), as there was not enough time to implement full responsiveness for the website. Please use it with that resolution, or at least 720p (1366x768), but not less.

## Features

- **Built with React:** The project utilizes React, enabling the creation of numerous reusable components for easy addition or removal of elements on the website.
- **Clarity:** The design prioritizes clarity to ensure that the message to the visitor is conveyed as clearly as possible.
- **Button and Element Effects:** Various elements, including buttons, cards, the navbar, and badges, have been enhanced with engaging effects to improve the overall user experience. These effects add interactivity and visual appeal.
- **Routing Ready:** All link tags are pre-configured as links, making it easy to add the respective site/section in the future.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** For building the user interface with reusable components.
- **CSS:** For styling the website to ensure consistency with the brand identity.
- **React Router:** For routing (if applicable in the future).

## Graphic Design Notes

### Font
- **Roboto:** This font is simple and serious at the same time. It conveys the seriousness of the company and maintains a professional appearance.

### Color
- **White:** White represents purity, cleanliness, and honesty. It is used to reflect the company's values and transparency, ensuring no tricks or hidden agendas.

### Drawings
- **Brochure Drawings:** The same drawings from the brochure are used to maintain the essence of the company. These elements align well with the overall design.

### Photography
- **Hero Image:** For the hero section, a USA flag is used instead of the original brochure image due to quality issues. A special shape design is applied to the hero image to enhance visual appeal.
