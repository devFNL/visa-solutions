# Visa Solutions Workforce (Interview Task)

This project was developed as part of an interview task for Visa Solutions Workforce.

## Project Description

The task was to create a home website based on a brochure. The main focus was on visual elements, requiring the integration of all brand materials and elements to ensure consistency and alignment with the brand identity.

## Important Note
The ideal resolution for this project is 1080p (1920x1080), as there was not enough time to implement full responsiveness for the website.

## Features

- **Built with React:** The project utilizes React, enabling the creation of numerous reusable components for easy addition or removal of elements on the website.
- **Clarity:** The design prioritizes clarity to ensure that the message to the visitor is conveyed as clearly as possible.
- **Button and Element Effects:** Various elements, including buttons, cards, the navbar, and badges, have been enhanced with engaging effects to improve the overall user experience. These effects add interactivity and visual appeal.
- **Routing Ready:** All link tags are pre-configured as links, making it easy to add the respective site/section in the future.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** For building the user interface with reusable components.
- **CSS:** For styling the website to ensure consistency with the brand identity.
- **React Router:** For routing (if applicable in the future).
